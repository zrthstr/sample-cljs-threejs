# sample-cljs-threejs

A sample of ClojureScript (cljs) canvas for live coding. Based on Figwheel-main & Three.js (cljsjs/three).

## Overview

Hello World-ish 3D live coding setup using ClojureScript.
Making use of Three.Js, Figwheel-main, WebGl
Supports auto-hot-reloading

## What happend so far
```
# install clojour, cljs, lein, figwheel-main ...
lein new figwheel-main <project-name>
```


## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    `lein fig:build`

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    `(js/alert "Am I connected?")`

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	`lein clean`

To create a production build run:

	`lein clean`
	`lein fig:min`
